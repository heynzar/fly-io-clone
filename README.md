## üéØ Why I Built It?

One day, I came across Fly.io's landing page and was instantly hooked. Its clean design and smooth functionality really stood out to me.

I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it, so I decided to try something new: recreate it from scratch. It felt like the perfect way to challenge myself and learn along the way.

And you know what? It truly deserved the effort.
